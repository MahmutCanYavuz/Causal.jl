The component behavior is defined by the mathematical equations obtained as a result of the physical laws that the physical quantities used in the modeling of the component must comply. Depending upon the nature of the system and the modeling, these equations may change, i.e. they may or may not contain derivative terms, or they may contain the continuous time or discrete time variable, etc. The components interact themselves through their input-output busses. The data-flow through the busses is unidirectional, i.e., a component is driven by other components that write data to its input bus.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Model simulation is performed by evolving the components individually.

The components can be grouped as sources, sinks, and systems. The sources are components that generate signals as functions of time. Having been triggered, a source computes its output according to its output function and writes it to its output bus. The sources do not have input busses as their outputs depend only on time. The sinks are data processing units. Their primary objectives are to process the data flowing through the busses of the model online. Having been triggered, a sink reads its input data and process them, i.e. data can be visualized by being plotted on the graphical user interface, can be observed by being printed on the console, can be stored on data files. The data processing capability of the sinks can be enriched by integrating new plugins that can be developed using the standard Julia library or various available Julia packages. For example, invariants, spectral properties or statistical information can be derived from the data, parameter estimation can be performed or various signal processing techniques can be applied on the data. JuSDL has been designed to be flexible enough to allow one to enlarge the scope of its available plugins by integrating newly-defined ones.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"<center>\n    <img src=\"assets/Components/components.png\" alt=\"model\" width=\"100%\"/>\n</center>","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"As the output of a static system depends on input and time, a static system is defined by an output equation. Having been triggered, a static system reads its input data, calculates its output according to its output function and writes it to its output bus. In dynamic systems, however, system behavior is characterized by states and output of a dynamic system depends on input, previous state and time. Therefore, a dynamic system is defined by a state equation and an output equation. When triggered, a dynamic system reads its input, update its state according to its state equation, calculates its output according to its output equation and writes its output to its output bus. JuSDL is capable of simulating the dynamic systems with state equations in the form of the ordinary differential equation(ODE), differential algebraic equation(DAE), random ordinary differential equation(RODE), stochastic differential equation(SDE), delay differential equation(DDE) or discrete difference equation. Most of the available simulation environments allow the simulation of systems represented by ordinary differential equations or differential algebraic equations. Therefore, analyzes such as noise analysis, delay analysis or random change of system parameters cannot be performed in these simulation environments. On the contrary, JuSDL makes it possible for all these analyses to be performed owing to its ability to solve such a wide range of state equations.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Busses-1","page":"Home","title":"Busses","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Busses consist of bunches of links.

The putter and the taker task is the task that writes data to and reads data from the channel, respectively. To be able to read data from one side of the channel, an active putter task must be bound to the chan- nel at the other side of the channel, and the channel is called a readable channel. Similarly, to be able to write data to one side of the channel, an active taker task must be bound to the channel at the other side, and the channel is called a writable channel. If both active putter and taker tasks are bound to either side of the channel, then the data can both be read from and written to the channel, and the channel is called a both readable and writable channel. The data-flow through the channel is only achieved if the channel is both readable and writable channel. The data read from a readable channel is the data written to the channel by the putter task of the channel. If data has not been written yet to the channel by the putter task of the channel during a reading process, then reading does not occur and the putter task is waited to put data to the channel. Similarly, if the data on the channel has not been read yet from the channel by the taker task during a writing process, then the taker task is waited to take data from the channel. In the modeling approach adopted, the components reading data from a bus are driven by other components writing data to the bus. Therefore, all of the busses of the model must be both readable and writable busses so that data can flow the busses. This means that all the busses of the model must be connected to a component from both ends. Otherwise, the simulation gets stuck and does not end during a reading process from a channel that is not connected to a component. During the simulation, the busses can be arranged as desired, the gain of the busses can be changed, new busses can be added or an existing bus can be broken. In other words, the structure of the system being simulated can change dynamically. This allows one to perform topological studies such as the investigation of the effects of change in the topology of a network or the change o coupling strengths on the behavior of the network.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Simulation-1","page":"Home","title":"Simulation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"A model to be simulated consists of components connected to each other and a time reference.

Instead, the model is evolved by evolving the components individually by solving their own mathematical equations. The components do not evolve in one shot, but instead, they evolve in parallel for during the time intervals between subsequent sampling instants. Here, it worths noting that the type of the mathematical equations of the components of a model does not have to be the same.
